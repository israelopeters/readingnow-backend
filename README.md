# Reading Now API
Reading Now is a simple Android app that lets you see the books other readers near you are reading. It uses AI to recommend a book for you based on your preferences. 
This backend API allows [the Android client](https://github.com/israelopeters/readingnow-frontend) access to the data store.

## MVP Features
The API allows the following functionality:

- Sign up/in as a user
- View a profile
- View posts of books being read
- Post a book you are reading
- Bookmark a book posted
- Request a book recommendation (AI)
